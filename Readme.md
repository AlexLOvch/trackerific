Description
We order mobile phones from dealers. Dealers ship them through Purolator:
http://www.purolator.com/
We want to display in our system what's going on with each shipment, based on it's tracking number.
Example tracking numbers: 330605984583, 330599320893, 330603276958, 330606984475
Sometimes dealers use other shipping providers, so please make sure your solution could be
extended to use them (UPS, FedEx, etc.)
